### Perception
- What is to be perceived?
- in the case of Shoshin (1v1), and assume perceptibles are entirely global i.e. same for every character:
  - the **character state** of each character (we may consider providing distance between 2 characters ootb because it is presumably the necessary feature required in most Agent state computation)
  - the **object state** of each character

### Naming thoughts
#### Christopher
- the agency 'VM' that executes 'bytecode' compiled from high-level expression of decision making procedures / state machines
- will grow into the standard for agency / artificial intelligence on-chain
- Agent state machine has access to constants such as those in `ns_character_dimension`, `ns_scene`, and `ns_env`, perhaps located at fixed memory location / with system register label

#### <some name>
- the engine to give Christopher 'actuators' and 'sensors'
- if Christopher is the subject, <some name> is the object. The two are in duality.
