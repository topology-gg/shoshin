### Christopher: a VM for agency on-chain

#### Key thought
1. To allow complex object behavior to interoperate across worlds is equivalent to have these worlds follow a similar compatible way of computation, becuase object behavior is manifested by computation e.g. the way a particular game's backend or engine takes an object behavior representation and turns it into being in the (virtual) world.
2. The thought above means simply: to achieve object behavior interoperability, we must standardize computation across worlds.
3. Naturally, the follow up question is: how do we standardize computation?
4. Answer is by inventing a "virtual machine" and its corresponding "bytecode" and drive them towards standards.
5. This is why Shoshin is a crucial step towards object behavior interoperability across worlds.

#### Mind
- Mind is a state machine that represents some decision making process
- Mind inhabits one state, among all its inhabitable states, at any given moment (frame); this also implies Mind is single-threaded
- Mind is composable -- the precondition to productivity and expressivity

#### Flavors of Mind
1. Atomic Mind
2. Composable Mind
